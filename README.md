# dockerised-laravel

This is supposed to be an alternative to Laravel Sail, as that wasn't working for me.

it's a stack composed of an nginx+php container, a nodeJS container and a database. optional websockets and redis.

Combined with a make file that enables rapid access to the project's most ran commands.
